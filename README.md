This task will get you to create a Vue JS app that will have a user enter in their UK post
code and plot that coordinate along with an existing group of UK post codes into a single
map. This task does not take into account of code efficiency, but would get extra points for
good styling. Resources for you to get started below:

<div> <-- ENTER POSTCODE --> </div>

<div> <-- ADD EXISTING GROUP OF POSTCODES --> </div>

<div> MAP: DISPLAYING PINS OF ENTERED POSTCODES </div>
